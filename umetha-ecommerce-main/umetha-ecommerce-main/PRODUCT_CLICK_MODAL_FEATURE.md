# Product Click Modal Feature

## Overview
This feature implements a comprehensive click functionality for all products displayed across the website, including those on the dashboard, search results, virtual try-on, and furniture try-on sections.

## Features

### 1. Product Modal
- **Component**: `components/product-tryon-modal.tsx`
- **Context**: `context/product-modal-context.tsx`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Displays product information in a modal
  - Shows "Try it on" and "Cancel" options
  - Automatically detects clothing-related products for virtual try-on

### 2. Click Handlers
- **ProductCard Component**: Updated to open modal on image click
- **Search Page**: Products open modal instead of direct navigation
- **Influencer Marketplace**: Product cards open modal on click
- **Products Page**: Uses updated ProductGrid with modal functionality

### 3. Virtual Try-On Integration
- **Preloading**: Selected products are stored in sessionStorage
- **Virtual Room**: Automatically loads preloaded products
- **Cart Integration**: Users can accept the look and add to cart

### 4. Cart Functionality
- **Auto-add**: Products are automatically added to cart when user accepts the look
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for successful additions
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed operations

## How It Works

### 1. Product Click Flow
1. User clicks on any product image across the website
2. Modal opens with product information
3. User sees "Try it on" option (if clothing-related) or "Add to Cart"
4. User can choose to:
   - Try it on (redirects to virtual fitting room)
   - Add to cart directly
   - Cancel

### 2. Virtual Try-On Flow
1. User clicks "Try it on" in modal
2. Product is stored in sessionStorage
3. User is redirected to `/virtual-room`
4. Virtual room loads the preloaded product
5. User uploads their photo
6. AI generates virtual try-on image
7. User can accept (adds to cart) or reject (try different look)

### 3. Clothing Detection
The system automatically detects clothing-related products using category matching:
- Dresses, shirts, blouses, tops, t-shirts
- Pants, jeans, trousers, skirts, shorts
- Jackets, blazers, coats, sweaters, hoodies
- Shoes, sneakers, boots, heels, sandals
- Bags, handbags, purses, backpacks, totes
- Accessories like hats, caps, scarves, belts, watches
