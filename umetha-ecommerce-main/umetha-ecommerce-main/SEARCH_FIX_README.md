# Search Functionality Fix

## Problem Identified

The search functionality was failing due to a **database schema mismatch** between the Prisma schema and the actual Supabase database schema. The main issues were:

1. **Missing Products Table**: The Supabase database didn't have a proper `products` table with the expected schema
2. **Schema Mismatch**: The code expected fields like `id`, `categoryId`, `stock`, `images` but the database had different field names and types
3. **Missing Relationships**: The relationship between products and categories wasn't properly set up
4. **Syntax Error**: There was a missing opening brace in the search API route (already fixed)

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Migration

Created a proper database schema migration file: `migrations/create_products_schema.sql`

This migration:
- Creates the `products` table with correct field names and types
- Creates the `categories` table with proper relationships
- Creates translation tables for multilingual support
- Sets up proper indexes for search performance
- Inserts sample data for testing

### 2. Updated Type Definitions

Updated `types/supabase/index.ts` to match the correct database schema with:
- Proper field names (`id` instead of `products_id`)
- Correct data types (string IDs instead of numbers)
- Added missing tables (categories, translations)

### 3. Fixed Search Functions

Updated `lib/supabase.ts` to use correct field names:
- Changed `products_id` to `id` in queries
- Fixed relationship queries to use proper field names

### 4. Created Helper Scripts

- `scripts/apply-database-migration.js`: Applies the database migration
- `scripts/test-search.js`: Tests the search functionality

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the migration script to create the proper database schema:

```bash
node scripts/apply-database-migration.js
```

**Alternative**: If the script doesn't work, manually run the SQL in `migrations/create_products_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

### Step 2: Test the Search

Run the test script to verify the search is working:

```bash
node scripts/test-search.js
```

### Step 3: Test in Browser

1. Go to `/search?q=t-shirt` in your browser
2. Try searching for other terms like "shoes", "electronics", "beauty"
3. The search should now return results instead of showing "0 results found"

## What the Fix Includes

### Database Schema
- **Products table** with proper fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `images`, `category_id`, `stock`, etc.
- **Categories table** with `id`, `name`, `slug`, `description`
- **Translation tables** for multilingual support
- **Proper relationships** between products and categories
- **Search indexes** for better performance

### Sample Data
The migration includes sample products in different categories:
- Fashion: T-shirts, jeans, shoes
- Electronics: smartphones, laptops
- Beauty: lipstick sets
- Home: coffee tables
- Sports: yoga mats

### Search Features
- **Fuzzy matching**: Searches for partial matches in product names and descriptions
- **Category search**: If you search for a category name, it returns all products in that category
- **Multi-word search**: Handles searches with multiple words
- **Case-insensitive**: Searches work regardless of case
- **Stock filtering**: Only shows products with available stock

## Testing the Search

After applying the fix, you can test these search queries:

1. **"t-shirt"** - Should return the Classic White T-Shirt
2. **"shoes"** - Should return the Running Shoes
3. **"electronics"** - Should return smartphone and laptop
4. **"fashion"** - Should return all fashion items (t-shirt, jeans, shoes)
5. **"beauty"** - Should return the lipstick set
6. **"laptop"** - Should return the laptop

## Troubleshooting

If the search still doesn't work:

1. **Check database connection**: Visit `/test-db` to verify the database is connected
2. **Verify migration**: Check if the products table exists in Supabase
3. **Check console errors**: Look for any JavaScript errors in the browser console
4. **Verify environment variables**: Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set

## Files Modified

- `migrations/create_products_schema.sql` (new)
- `types/supabase/index.ts` (updated)
- `lib/supabase.ts` (updated)
- `app/search/page.tsx` (improved error handling)
- `scripts/apply-database-migration.js` (new)
- `scripts/test-search.js` (new)

The search functionality should now work properly and return relevant results for any product search query.
